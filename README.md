Program 1: Singly Linked List in C++
Aim:To implement a singly linked list in C++ and perform various linked list operations.

### Algorithm

1. Define a node structure containing data and a pointer to the next node.
2. Initialize the head pointer to "nullptr".
3. Perform the linked list operations as required.
4. Display the linked list after performing the operations.

### Time Complexity

- Insertion at the beginning: O(1)
- Insertion at the end: O(n)
- Deletion: Depends on the position and implementation.
- Traversal and display: O(n)
- Searching: O(n)

### Test Cases

| Test Case | Operation | Expected Result |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Insert 10, 20, 30 at end | 10 -> 20 -> 30 -> NULL |
| 2 | Insert 5 at beginning | 5 -> 10 -> 20 -> 30 -> NULL |
| 3 | Search for 20 | 20 found at position 3 |
| 4 | Search for 50 | 50 not found in the list |
| 5 | Delete 20 | 20 deleted successfully |
| 6 | Display the list | 5 -> 10 -> 30 -> NULL |

**### Output

```text
Linked List: 5 -> 10 -> 20 -> 30 -> NULL
20 found at position 3.
50 not found in the list.
20 deleted successfully.
Linked List: 5 -> 10 -> 30 -> NULL**

## Program 2: Doubly Linked List in C++

### Aim
To implement a doubly linked list in C++ and perform insertion and traversal operations.

### Description
A doubly linked list is a linear data structure in which each node contains data, a pointer to the previous node, and a pointer to the next node. It allows traversal in both forward and backward directions.

### Algorithm
1. Create a node structure containing data, a previous pointer, and a next pointer.
2. Initialize the head and tail pointers to NULL.
3. Insert elements at the end or beginning of the list.
4. Traverse from head to tail to display the list in forward order.
5. Traverse from tail to head to display the list in backward order.

### Time Complexity

| Operation | Time Complexity |
|---|---|
| Insert at beginning | O(1) |
| Insert at end | O(1) |
| Display forward | O(n) |
| Display backward |
